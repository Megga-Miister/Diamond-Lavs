## Conflict Plan 

What will your group do when it encounters a conflict?
  We will sit down as a group and talk it out. We want to address what the conflict is, then discuss what everyone's motivations and intentions are. We believe that understanding where everyone is coming from will help us navigate any miscommunications to get us on the same page. We can then define goals further if necessary.

How will we raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  As a group we have very clear intentions of working on waffle.io tickets and logging our work that way. If a member is not adequately contributing we will discuss and assign tickets to the individual as it fits their skill set. We also will discuss the why behind the lack of contribution, in order to see if the why can be resolved.

What is your process to resolve conflicts?
  We will have a discussion as a group and then come to a verbal agreement across all members. If not everyone can agree then it will go to a vote. The solution that gets the majority vote is what we will go forward with.

How and when will we escalate a conflict if our attempts are unsuccessful?
  We are planning to use a two stikes, of going through the group discussion and addressing the issue, method. If the same type of conflict with the same individual comes up a third time, we will be bringing it to a TA or Brian's attention.
