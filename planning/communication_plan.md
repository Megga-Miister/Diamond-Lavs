## Communication Plan

How will we communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  We will communicate over slack and through text.

What is our strategy for ensuring everyone's voice is heard?
  We plan on having each member give their input on whatever component we are discussing. If someone is not consistently talking they will be called out to share their thoughts. We at the very least want some sort of affirmation that we are on the same page, or have heard out any member's suggestions/ideas.

  We will be having a check-in to see how everyone is feeling and what they want to share aside from the normal stand up, once in the morning and once before we leave in the evening.

How will we ensure that we are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  We will be going over pro's and con's of ideas, as opposed to shooting something down without an obvious reason. We will also be consistently checking in with eachother to see how they are feeling, and how they are progressing. The constant emphasis is that we are a team, the goal is to succeed together not just as individuals.
