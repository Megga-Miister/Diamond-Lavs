User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to pin point my location, so that I can easily add my address so the app can direct me to nearby restrooms.
As a user, I want to be able to find a restroom close by, so that I can quickly access it.
As a user, I want to be able to review the restroom, so that I can let others know how it rates.

As a developer, I want my users to be able to add new restrooms, so we can expand our database.
As a developer, I want my users to easily be able to navigate my app, so users will be more likely to add ratings and locations to the database.
As a developer, I want my database to be built with normalization so the different tables data can be easily found with a search query.
